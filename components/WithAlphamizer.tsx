                Factor rotations can overwhelm single-stock moves. Fundamental

              <p className="paragraph-b1">
                The most common failure point for funds is factor rotations,
                positioning offsides, and poor book construction -
                <strong>not bad residual single stock selection</strong>. Alphamizer
                puts you a step ahead of systematic and consensus whipsaws to
                isolate returns in your idio.

                Alphamizer enables you to focus on what can be controlled, armed
                with the full toolkit from optimal hedge idea screens, to
                exposure monitoring, to ownership &amp; crowding tracking, and
                much more. So you can see what others miss, avoid low-value
                volatility, and
                <strong>make your investment decisions intentional</strong>.
